[^9]: mSATA Mini-Serial ATA s a version of the SATA interface for solid state drives (SSDs) in mobile devices. It comes with a smaller form factor than a standard SSD and is designed for use with portable, power-constrained devices such as laptops, tablets and netbooks, used like a hard disk drive in a processor.
